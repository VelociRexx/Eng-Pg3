    <h1>Watchmen</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If Starship Troopers was a total shock to fans of the novel when the movie
      was released, Watchmen was more of a steady rise to a total blindside to
      fans of the comics. Director
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder">Zack Snyder</a> had
      made many scenes from the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">comics</a> 1:1 copies in
      the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(2009_film)"
        >movie adaptation</a
      >, and aside from removing parts of the comic books that were not easy to
      put into the movie or didn’t add much to the story, the movie was quite
      similar to the comic. That was, until the ending of the movie. The ending
      was almost entirely different from the comics, and yet, Watchmen is still
      a great adaptation of the original comics. That is because the ideas and
      themes the comics had were preserved in the movie, even though a huge part
      of the story was changed.

      Throughout the comics, there was a secondary comic line within the
      Watchmen series, called “<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen#Tales_of_the_Black_Freighter"
        >Tales of the Black Freighter</a
      >.” These comics followed a mariner trying to make it back to his village
      to warn of the danger of the coming pirate ship, the Black Freighter,
      which had previously destroyed his own ship. The comic is extremely dark,
      and through the comics we see the mariner slowly abandon their ideals as
      they rush to warn their village of the coming danger. When his ship is
      destroyed, he uses the bodies of his dead comrades as a raft to try and
      get to his village, all while slowly becoming insane. When he reaches his
      hometown, he is under the impression that the town is already under the
      pirates control, and upon reaching his home, he kills everyone there. He
      realizes that the person he believed to be a pirate was actually his wife,
      and the village wasn’t under the pirates control. The mariner returns to
      the shore, and sees the black freighter, waiting for him. He swims aboard,
      and the comic ends there. While you can certainly draw connections from
      the main story of the novel to the comic within a comic, in no way do any
      of the main characters interact with it, and it doesn’t change them at
      all. In the end, cutting the “Tales of the Black Freighter” comic out of
      the theatrical release doesn’t remove any character interactions, and
      makes Watchmen’s story better suited for a movie.

      Other than the “Tales of the Black Freighter,” the story of the movie is
      extremely similar to the story of the comics. The story takes place in
      1985, with an extremely dark and depressing setting, in an alternate
      history where superheroes worked with the government before being outlawed
      in 1977. The U.S is in a very different political state, in which they won
      the vietnam war in 1971, and the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal"
        >Watergate scandal</a
      >
      was never exposed. Crime is running rampant, and the two superpowers of
      the world are escalating. The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">Doomsday Clock</a>
      sits at 5 minutes until midnight. The story begins with the murder of a
      man in New York. A masked vigilante called Rorschach decides to probe
      further, and discovers that the murdered man was Edward “Eddie” Blake, who
      was better known as “The Comedian,” another vigilante that was formerly
      employed by the U.S. government. Fearing further attacks against former
      heroes, Rorschach visits each of the other former members of The Watchmen,
      a government superhero team of which he was a part of. These members are:
      Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl II, Laurie
      Juspeczyk AKA Silver Spectre II, and Jon Osterman AKA Doctor Manhattan.
      All of them are skeptical about Rorschach’s conspiracy, but they don’t
      dismiss it. After Blake’s funeral, Doctor Manhattan is accused of causing
      cancer to friends and colleagues, and exiles himself to Mars. Adrian Veidt
      survives an assassination attempt, but the attacker dies to a hidden
      cyanide capsule. Rorschach is later captured and imprisoned after being
      framed for the murder of former supervillain Moloch, and his identity is
      revealed to be Walter Kovacs. Dreidberg and Juspeczyk, who have been
      forming a relationship, agree that they need to go rescue Rorschach from
      prison. While attempting to do so, Juspeczyk, who was now Doctor
      Manhattan’s second ex-lover, was teleported to Mars to present a case for
      why he should care about humanity. She succeeds only after finding out
      that her biological father was Eddie Blake, who had attempted to rape her
      mother (he fathered her in a second consentual relationship). Rorschach
      and Dreidberg uncover evidence that Veidt is behind the murder of Blake,
      and journey to his antarctic hideout for the climax of the story. There
      are slight differences to the comics and the movie up to this point, but
      they are very similar to each other. All of the previously described
      actions happen in both the comic and the movie. However, beyond this
      point, the similarities end.

      In the comic book, Dreidberg and Rorschach find Veidt at his base, where
      he tells them everything. Veidt’s plan was to create a fake alien invasion
      that would force humanity to put aside their differences and come together
      to fight this new, extremely dangerous outside threat. The two vow to put
      an end to Veidt’s plan, but he reveals that it had already begun before
      they arrived. Doctor Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on earth to a
      devastated New York City, where a giant squid-like creature lay dead in
      the streets. Sensing tachyons around the city emanating from the
      Antarctic, the two teleport there and discover Veidt and his plan. Veidt
      shows the group of now four the news that the reveal of danger from
      otherworldly creatures has led to peaceful cooperation between the world
      powers. The Watchmen agree that it is in the best interest to keep this
      information secret, except for Rorschach, who believes he must reveal the
      truth to everyone. However, he is killed by Doctor Manhattan to preserve
      the secret. Doctor Manhattan then leaves Earth, and Dreidberg and
      Juspeczyk go into hiding with new identities. In the Movie, Dreidberg and
      Rorschach again arrive at Veidt’s base, and again, Veidt tells them his
      plan. The difference is that in the movie, Veidt’s plan was to frame
      Doctor Manhattan by detonating all of the nuclear reactors that Doctor
      Manhattan had worked on/built with Veidt. Just like the comics, Doctor
      Manhattan teleports to a completely destroyed New York with Juspeczyk,
      pieces together what has happened, and teleports to the Antarctic base
      that Veidt resided at. Veidt again shows the four that the world is
      agreeing to work together peacefully to defend from the common enemy,
      Doctor Manhattan. Again, just like the book, the Watchmen agree to keep
      the secret safe, except for Rorschach, who is promptly killed by Doctor
      Manhattan. Both the comic and the movie end with a newspaper editor
      reaching towards the pile of public submissions, where Rorschach’s journal
      was located. The reason Watchmen is still a great adaptation of the comic
      book series is because the movie preserves the themes that encapsulate the
      comics. The “Tales of the Black Freighter” comic within a comic was
      removed because it didn’t mesh well with the movie being on the big
      screen. The director was able to get away with changing the ending of the
      movie because the ending they made it into was still one that stuck to the
      themes that the comic wanted to convey, that in order to truly and totally
      unite humanity, you must have an outside, bigger threat for them to be
      scared of.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the end, Director Zack Snyder chose to remove parts of the comics that
      wouldn’t work out well on the big screen, and changed the ending, but by
      keeping to the themes established in the comics, Snyder was able to create
      almost a better version of the story, which incorporates other aspects of
      the story, instead of Veidt just creating monsters to teleport into New
      York.
